Can run the notebook (rag setup). Will need a supabase db, open ai key, and gmail key.

Currently my supabase db has a table called `messages` with the following columns:
- id
- role
- content
- created_at

right now I have loaded my gmail newsletters into the db. 

The notebook currently outputs a nice macro outlook report but still working on structuring the output. 

 Rain will be the operations (multiple agents) to support me in managing my personal portfolio.
