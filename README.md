Can clone, but will need a supabase db, open ai key, and gmail key. 

Currently my supabase db has a table called `messages` with the following columns:
- id
- role
- content
- created_at

had shut the live version of this down because supabase compute was getting expensive.
Adapted a version of this script and set up for a VC client
